          You acknowledge that TEAM Authkey delivers SMS&#39;s via major telecom
          operators and can therefore only influence the delivery transmission
          of SMS within the technical constraints imposed. SMS&#39;s submitted
          via Internet will be transferred to mobile network providers provided
          that the recipient&#39;s phone is switched on and doesn&#39;t have a
          full memory and is located in an area covered by its subscribed mobile
          network provider. You acknowledge that depending on the
          recipient&#39;s mobile provider service, it may not be possible to
          transmit the SMS to the recipient successfully.

          delays or message failures. While TEAM Authkey makes every effort to
          deliver messages promptly.
        </li>
        <li>
          TEAM Authkey doesn&#39;t refund the credits for undeliverable messages
          to you because we cannot guarantee delivery of the SMS&#39;s to
          recipients due to possible errors. TEAM Authkey debits transmitted
          SMS&#39;s according to its transmission logs. These logs are deemed
          correct and valid even if the customer has objected to the correctness
          of the accounting records except if an investigation by TEAM Authkey
          has produced evidence of a technical problem or error.
        </li>
        <li>
          TEAM Authkey reserves the right to exclude you from using this
          service, refunding you any remaining amount in your account. All
          purchases must be considered as final in compliance with our no refund
          policy.
        </li>
        <li>
          The SMS account balance is non-refundable and does not bear any
          interest. All the SMS&#39;s must be used in the validity period from
          the date of the purchase. No carry forward of the credits will be made
          unless otherwise defined in a separate contract.
        </li>
        <li>
          You undertake the entire responsibility regarding the messages sent
          through <a href="https://Authkey.pro/">https://Authkey.pro/</a>{" "}
          services from your account which are transmitted as per your request.
        </li>
        <li>
          You shall indemnify and reimburse TEAM Authkey all liabilities, costs,
          losses, and damages in case of any claim brought against TEAM Authkey
          from any third party due to breach of contract.
        </li>
        <li>
          You shall in no way raise questions concerning our price policy since
          it is liable to change with due amendments in the Government TRAI or
          Telecom Operators&#39; rules and regulations or for any other reasons.

          Limitations of Liability Disclaimer
        </h2>
        <p>
          Except for any of our explicit warranties and our obligations we are
          offering our Services “as is.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Whilst we will take all reasonable steps to deliver your messages to
          the recipients as fast as possible we cannot commit to or guarantee a
          specific delivery time. Such times depend on various network and
          system-related factors among the various entities involved in the
          transportation of your messages across the cellular mobile networks.
        </p>
        <p>
          You acknowledge that as we send and receive text-messages via major
          telecommunication companies and Mobile Network Operators our influence
          over the transmission of your messages is within the technical
          constraints imposed upon us.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our responsibility is therefore to ensure that the text-messages you
          send through the service are processed correctly and delivered to the
          assigned entity. We are not responsible for the final delivery of the
          message as this is out of our control and is the responsibility of the
          Mobile Network Operator.
        </p>
        <p>
          SMS&#39;s that cannot be delivered within the lifespan allocated to
          them either by us or a Mobile Network Operator will be discarded by
          the Mobile Network Operator without any notice. We are not liable for
          any loss incurred by the failure of a message to be delivered and you
          acknowledge that damages concerning financial or other loss resulting
          from delivery failure cannot be claimed from Team Authkey.
          Furthermore, you agree that the message contents are deemed to have
          zero value.
        </p>
        <p>
          You also acknowledge that text-messages are transmitted unencrypted
          and that eavesdropping of mobile phone communications, including SMS
          delivery by third parties, is possible. We also recommend that you
          ensure sensitive and valuable information is communicated by a number
          of superior communication methods.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, use of the service and the Internet is at its own risk
          and that the service is provided “as is” and “as available” without
          any warranties or conditions whatsoever expressed or implied. We will
          apply all commercially reasonable efforts to make access to the
          service available through the required access protocols but make no
          warranty or guarantee that you will be able to access the service at
          any particular time or any particular location.

          Without limiting the generality of the terms set forth, we and our
          affiliates, agents, content providers, service providers, and
          licensees hereby disclaim all express and implied warranties as to the
          accuracy, completeness, non-infringement, merchantability, or fitness
          for particular purpose of the service generally and any content or
          services contained therein, as well as all express and implied
          warranties that the operation of the service generally and any
          contender services contained therein will be uninterrupted or
          error-free.
        </p>
        <p>
          We shall in no event be liable for any inaccuracy, error, or omission
          in or loss, injury, or damage caused in whole or in part by failures,
          delays, or interruptions of the service generally and any aspect
          ancillary thereto; you agree to indemnify us for any third-party
          claims arising from such failures, delays, or interruptions in
          connection with regard to the use of the service.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not withstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the
          provisions outlined above are for the benefit of Team Authkey and its

          Modification of Terms
        </h2>
        <p>
          Our terms are aligned and subject to modification according to laws
          and guidelines by local government bodies.
        </p>
        <p>
          We frequently update, modify, and otherwise continually seek to
          improve the service and such changes often dictate that we
          simultaneously modify the terms and conditions of use. As such we have
          the right to modify the terms of this agreement and to change or
          discontinue any aspect or feature of our service in either case as it
          deems reasonably necessary. If you do not agree with any such changes
          your use of the service may be cancelled in accordance with the
          procedures for cancellation set forth in this agreement. You
          acknowledge your responsibility to review this agreement from time to
          time and to be aware of any such changes and should you request we
          will be happy to keep you informed if/when such changes take place.
          Furthermore, you accept that should there be a contradiction between
          other specific terms and conditions and these general terms and
          conditions the other specific terms and conditions shall apply.
        </p>

        <h2 className="my-4 text-lg font-bold text-black">Termination</h2>
        <p>Any breach can result in termination. You have equal rights.</p>
        <p>
          If at any time you breach the terms and conditions of the service we
          may elect to suspend, terminate, and/or cancel this agreement and/or
          recover any damages from you arising from the event(s) giving rise to
          the suspension, termination, or cancellation. We reserve the right to
          suspend your service at any stage for any reason we may deem necessary
          to continue to provide any of our services in a way that may be
          hindered by your status as being our client, your financial status, or
          the content of the messages originating from you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Upon any such termination, cancellation, and/or suspension you are
          still responsible for any obligations than accrued. Payment and other
          obligations under this agreement are not suspended, stayed, or
          otherwise affected by a suspension of access to/or use of the service
          (in whole or in part) where said suspension arises from your failure
          to comply with or violation of the terms of this agreement or of any
          law or legal obligation. Upon termination and/or cancellation for any
          reason, you agree to immediately cease using the service and we shall
          have no obligation to you after any termination or cancellation of
          this agreement.
        </p>
        <p>
          You are also free to terminate or cancel this agreement at any time
          and for any reason. For such termination or cancellation to be
          effective, however, you must inform us in writing through Email. You
          will still be under the responsibilities of this agreement for the
          duration that you used the service and you will cease to have access
          to the use of any credits that may exist in your account.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our terms and conditions as well as the prices are subject to change
