        <p>
          Authkey does not own, control, or directly oversee the utilization of
          any of the Client Data stored or processed by a Client or User through
          the Service. Only the Client or Users have the authority to access,
          retrieve, and govern the use of such Client Data. Authkey has limited
          awareness of the specific Client Data being stored or made accessible
          by a Client or User through the Service. Authkey does not directly
          access this Client Data except when authorized by the Client or when
          necessary to provide Services to the Client and its Users.
        </p>
        <p>
          As Authkey neither collects nor determines the usage of any Personal
          Data within the Client Data, and because it doesn&#39;t establish the
          purposes, methods of collection, or the uses of this Personal Data,
          Authkey is not operating as a data controller under the European
          Union&#39;s General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU)
          2016/679, &quot;GDPR&quot;). Thus, it does not carry the associated
          responsibilities stipulated by the GDPR. Authkey should be regarded
          solely as a data processor on behalf of its Clients and Users
          concerning any Client Data containing Personal Data that falls under
          the GDPR&#39;s requirements. Except as outlined in this Privacy
          Policy, Authkey does not independently facilitate the transfer or
          provision of Client Data containing Personal Data to third parties.
          This is only done through third-party subcontractors who may process
          such data on behalf of Authkey while delivering Services to Clients.
          Such actions are executed or authorized solely by the respective
          Client or User.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Client or the User, as per the Regulation, serves as the data
          controller for any Client Data containing Personal Data. This means
          that such a party governs the method by which Personal Data is
          collected and utilized, as well as determining the purposes and means
          of processing such Personal Data.

          which grants individuals the right to legally pursue enforceable
          rights against data collectors and processors who fail to comply with
          the law. This principle not only ensures that individuals have
